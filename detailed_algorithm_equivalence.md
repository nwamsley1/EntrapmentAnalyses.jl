# Detailed Analysis: Are the Java and Julia Algorithms Truly Equivalent?

## Understanding the Data Structure

First, let's establish the sorted order:
- **Position 0**: Best score (highest confidence)
- **Position i**: Current threshold 
- **Position > i**: Scores worse than threshold

## Java Algorithm Deep Dive

For calculating FDR at threshold position `i`:

### First Loop (lines 44-89):
```java
for(int k=0; k<=i; k++) {
    // Builds all_hits: ALL sequences from position 0 to i
    // Counts n_targets and n_entrapment_targets up to threshold
}
```

### Second Loop (lines 99-201):
```java
for(int k=i; k>=0; k--) {  // Going from WORST (i) to BEST (0)
    // Builds cur_hits incrementally
    // At iteration k, cur_hits contains positions [i, i-1, ..., k]
}
```

### The Key Logic for Entrapments:
When processing an entrapment at position k:
1. **Paired target in `cur_hits`**: Target is at position between k and i (inclusive)
   - Both entrapment and target are â‰¥ threshold
   - Increment `n_p_t_s`

2. **Paired target NOT in `all_hits`**: Target is at position > i
   - Entrapment â‰¥ threshold, but target < threshold  
   - Increment `n_p_s_t`

3. **Paired target in `all_hits` but NOT in `cur_hits`**: Target is at position < k
   - This means the target scores BETTER than the entrapment
   - This case contributes nothing special to the formula

## Julia Algorithm Analysis

Our implementation directly compares scores:
```julia
for i in 1:n  # For each threshold position
    s = scores[sort_order[i]]  # Threshold score
    for j in 1:i  # Check all positions up to threshold
        if entrapment at position j:
            if entrapment_score >= s AND target_score >= s:
                NÎµÏ„s++  # Both above threshold
            elseif entrapment_score >= s AND target_score < s:
                NÎµsÏ„++  # Only entrapment above threshold
```

## The Critical Question: Are These Equivalent?

### Scenario Analysis

Let's trace through a specific example:
- Positions: 0 (best) to 5 (worst)
- Threshold at position 3
- Entrapment E at position 1, paired target T at position 4

**Java approach**:
- `all_hits` = {positions 0,1,2,3} 
- When k=1: `cur_hits` = {positions 3,2,1}
- E is at position 1, T at position 4
- T is NOT in `all_hits` â†’ increment `n_p_s_t`

**Julia approach**:
- Threshold score s = score at position 3
- E score > s (position 1), T score < s (position 4)
- Increment `NÎµsÏ„`

âœ“ **These give the same result!**

### Edge Case: What if both win but at different positions?

Example: E at position 1, T at position 2 (both above threshold at position 3)

**Java**:
- When k=1: `cur_hits` = {3,2,1}
- T IS in `cur_hits` â†’ increment `n_p_t_s`

**Julia**:
- Both E and T scores > threshold score
- But wait... the Java code doesn't check WHO WINS!
- Java increments `n_p_t_s` regardless of whether E > T or T > E

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL FINDING ðŸš¨

**The algorithms are NOT equivalent!**

The Java implementation counts differently:
- `n_p_t_s`: ANY entrapment where both members of the pair are above threshold
- `n_p_s_t`: Entrapments above threshold with paired target below

The Julia implementation (from the notebook) is more sophisticated:
- `NÎµÏ„s`: Entrapments that WIN (E > T) AND target is above threshold  
- `NÎµsÏ„`: Entrapments above threshold with target below

## The Key Difference

**Java**: Counts based purely on threshold position
**Julia**: Counts based on threshold position AND winning relationship

This means:
1. If E > T and both > threshold: Java adds to `n_p_t_s`, Julia adds to `NÎµÏ„s` âœ“
2. If T > E and both > threshold: Java adds to `n_p_t_s`, Julia adds nothing âœ—
3. If E > threshold > T: Both add to their respective counters âœ“

## Conclusion

The algorithms are **NOT equivalent**. The Julia implementation is more stringent, only counting entrapments that actually "win" against their paired targets, while the Java implementation counts any entrapment as long as position criteria are met.

This could lead to different FDR estimates, with the Java version potentially being more conservative (higher FDR) in cases where many targets beat their paired entrapments.
