# EntrapmentAnalyses.jl Implementation Progress

## Completed Objectives ✓

### 1. **Project Setup**
- Created module structure with proper directory hierarchy
- Updated Project.toml with all required dependencies (Parquet2, CSV, DataFrames, Plots, ProgressBars)
- Set up main module file with proper includes and exports

### 2. **Data Loading**
- Implemented Parquet file loader with validation
- Implemented TSV spectral library loader
- Added automatic dummy channel creation for missing channel columns
- Included proper error handling for missing files and columns

### 3. **Efficient Pairing System**
- Implemented vector-based pairing computation (avoiding dictionary lookups in main loops)
- Created pre-computed pairing vectors for O(1) access during EFDR calculation
- Added progress monitoring for pairing operations
- Included validation for unpaired sequences

### 4. **EFDR Methods**
- Implemented combined EFDR calculation with vector inputs
- Implemented paired EFDR with O(n²) algorithm and progress monitoring
- Added sort order validation for q-values
- Created both function-based and struct-based interfaces
- Included pre-computation of score relationships for efficiency

### 5. **Q-value Calculations**
- Implemented target-decoy q-value calculation with proper sorting
- Added monotonization function for FDR correction
- Created both precursor-level and global q-value calculations
- Included sort order validation throughout

### 6. **Protein-Level Analysis**
- Implemented protein rollup following notebook logic exactly
- Added per-run protein q-value calculation
- Created type-stable helper functions to avoid DataFrame column type instability
- Implemented protein-level EFDR calculation using same methods as precursors

### 7. **Visualization**
- Implemented plots with exact notebook styling:
  - Size: 600x450 pixels (400*1.5, 300*1.5)
  - Color: RGB(0.39215686, 0.58431373, 0.92941176)
  - Alpha: 0.75, Line width: 3
  - Font sizes: title=16, axis labels=16, ticks=12
- Created separate functions for precursor and protein plots
- Added vector-based plotting function for flexibility

## Remaining Objectives

### 8. **Main API Functions** (HIGH PRIORITY)
- [ ] Create `run_efdr_analysis()` for precursor-level analysis
- [ ] Create `run_protein_efdr_analysis()` for protein-level analysis
- [ ] Implement notebook-compatible dictionary creation for pairing
- [ ] Add comprehensive output generation (TSV files, plots)
- [ ] Include proper error handling and validation

### 9. **Testing Infrastructure** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- [ ] Write unit tests for:
  - [ ] Pairing functions
  - [ ] EFDR calculations
  - [ ] Q-value calculations
  - [ ] Protein rollup
- [ ] Create integration tests with sample data
- [ ] Test with multi-run data to verify per-run calculations
- [ ] Validate output matches notebook implementation

### 10. **Documentation and Examples** (LOW PRIORITY)
- [ ] Create usage examples
- [ ] Write comprehensive docstrings for all public functions
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md with specific instructions for this module
- [ ] Create sample data for testing

## Key Implementation Notes

1. **Vector-Based Design**: All core functions work with abstract vectors for type stability and performance
2. **Type Assertions**: DataFrame columns are accessed with type assertions to avoid type instability
3. **No TMT References**: Generic "multiplex channel" terminology used throughout
4. **Notebook Compatibility**: Accepts exact same data format as notebook (Parquet + TSV)
5. **Sort Validation**: All sorting operations include validation warnings

## Next Steps

1. Implement the main API functions that tie everything together
2. Create the notebook-style dictionary pairing for compatibility
3. Add comprehensive testing
4. Validate against notebook outputs with real data
